#  Round System
# ---------------
# The Round system consist of both the Preround and the actual Round. To do this, it contains a scoreboard that helps get all
# the timers in their place. Same goes for playing and started, which helps the game tell if the game and round is going at
# that current moment.

# OST is added later and the bomb is used to help tell which team wins. Pause is for pausing, should be simple to know.
